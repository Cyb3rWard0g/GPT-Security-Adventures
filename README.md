# GPT Security Adventures
Welcome to the GPT Security Adventures repository! This repository contains a collection of experiments and adventures that explore the intersection of security and natural language processing using GPT models.

## Goal
The goal of this repository is to showcase the potential applications of GPT models in the security domain and to encourage others to experiment with these models for security-related tasks. We believe that machine learning and natural language processing can provide valuable insights and help us better understand complex security challenges.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from anyone interested in exploring the intersection of security and natural language processing using GPT models. If you have an experiment or adventure you'd like to share, please feel free to submit a pull request!
