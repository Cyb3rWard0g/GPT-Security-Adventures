# GPT Security Adventures
Welcome to the GPT Security Adventures repository! This repository contains a collection of experiments and adventures that explore the intersection of security and natural language processing using GPT models.

## Introduction
The goal of this repository is to showcase the potential applications of GPT models in the security domain and to encourage others to experiment with these models for security-related tasks. We believe that machine learning and natural language processing can provide valuable insights and help us better understand complex security challenges.

## Folder Structure
The repository is organized into several folders, each representing a different adventure or experiment that explores the capabilities of GPT models in the security domain. Here's a brief overview of a few folders:

* [ATTCK-GPT](experiments/ATTCK-GPT/README.md): Contains experiments that use GPT-based techniques to create an embedding/index of MITRE ATT&CK information, which can be queried with natural language. This experiment aims to facilitate the exploration and understanding of the MITRE ATT&CK Groups information by providing a natural language interface for querying and searching the data.

## Getting Started
To get started with the experiments in this repository, clone the repository to your local machine and follow the instructions in the individual README files in each folder.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from anyone interested in exploring the intersection of security and natural language processing using GPT models. If you have an experiment or adventure you'd like to share, please feel free to submit a pull request!
